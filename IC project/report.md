## Introduction

### Objective
- Designing a custom language named C-- with pseudo-code syntax
- Implementing a tic tac toe game where users play against a bot

### Key Features
- C-- lexer, parser and interpreter
- A Tic Tac Toe bot using minimax
- Key features of language include pseudo-code like syntax (syntax is well explained in readme file), having datatypes of complex data structures like linkedlists and dictionaries, hassle-free memory management and easy to learn

## Implementation

### 2.1 C-- Lexer, Parser and Interpreter 
- Custom Datatypes : Creating custom datatypes like string , dictionary, linkedlist and even for the usual datatypes like integer, character as well
- Tokenization : Handled by lexer which breaks the entire code into tokens of keywords (like `create`) , datatypes (like `string`), operators (like `==`), identifiers, strings and numbers and returns them to the parser.
- Grammar Rules : Handled by the parser which gets the tokens from the lexer and defines the grammar rules for statements (like `var_dec`, `assign`,etc.) for our language. 
- AST : The Abstract Syntax Tree is created by the parser which is then sent to the interpreter for execution where each node represents a specific operation or statement in the program.
